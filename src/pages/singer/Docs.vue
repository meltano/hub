      <h2>Commitment to the Singer Community</h2>
      <p>
        The Meltano team aims to make MeltanoHub a fantastic resource for members of the Singer
        Community. We’re fully embracing Singer and MeltanoHub for Singer is a large part of those
        efforts.
      </p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>
        MeltanoHub is under active development by Meltano. Check out our issue tracker to understand
        progress on a specific feature.
      </p>

      <h2>Standardized Connectors</h2>
      <p>
        All taps and targets are pulled from external sources, such as GitHub and GitLab, and are
        organized into a clean YAML format that has no references to external tools. Learn more
        about the architecture of MeltanoHub for Singer here.
      </p>

      <p>
        All taps and targets available through MeltanoHub are listed on the Taps and Targets pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each tap and target is defined in YAML and is validated against a JSON Schema available via
        the Hub API.
      </p>

      <h3>Connector Metadata</h3>
      <p>
        Each connector page lists revelant information about the maintainer of the connector along
        with its maintenance status.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, metrics such as last update, stars, and open issues and PRs, are pulled from
        GitHub. These are useful proxy metrics for the quality of a given connector.
      </p>

      <h2>API</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>API Directory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A listing of all taps and targets is available via the API as JSON. The latest version of
        these files will always be available at these endpoints:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tap JSON</li>
        <li>Target JSON</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These files will also be versioned when changes are made in a backwards-incompatible way.
        The versioned files will be available through the API. Individual YAML files are also
        available through the individual connector pages or on the repository building MeltanoHub.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our expectation is that other tools, including Meltano, will utilize the data available via
        the API to build their own library of Singer taps and targets.
      </p>
      <h2>Tap and Target SDKs</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve also created an SDK for Taps and Targets that is the best way to build and maintain
        Singer Taps and Targets.
      </p>

      <p>Read more about the launch of the SDK on the Meltano blog.</p>

      <h2>Singer Spec</h2>
      <p>
        We’ve created a simplified version of the Singer Specification with the goal of making it
        easier for people new to the Singer ecosystem to understand the spec.
      </p>

      <h2>Singer Connector Capabilities</h2>
      <p>
        The Singer Specification does a great job defining how taps and targets should communicate
        with each other at a high level but there’s an additional layer of commonly used patterns
        and best practices that have emerged from the community which aren’t documented in the spec
        that we’re calling “capabilities”. The following is our distilled list of the existing (and
        some future) capabilities that are commonly used by the Singer Community:
      </p>

      <h3>Tap Specific</h3>
      <h4>Catalog</h4>
      <p>
        The tap accepts a --catalog argument referencing a file that defines the structure of one or
        many data streams. For more details see the Catalog Files section in our Singer Spec
        interpretation.
      </p>

      <h4>Properties</h4>
      <p>
        The tap accepts the legacy --properties argument referencing a file that defines the
        structure of one or many data streams. For more details see the Catalog Files section in our
        Singer Spec interpretation.
      </p>

      <h4>Discover</h4>
      <p>
        The tap accepts a --discover argument that is used to generate a catalog files. For more
        details see the Discovery mode section section in our Singer Spec interpretation.
      </p>

      <h4>State</h4>
      <p>
        The tap accepts a --state argument and uses the input in order to run incremental syncs. For
        more details see the State Files section section in our Singer Spec interpretation.
      </p>

      <h4>Log Based</h4>
      This is a database source specific capability which supports reading the transaction logs of a
      database in order to identify incrementally changed data. The two common replication
      techniques are key-based or log-based replication. Key-based uses a timestamp or incrementing
      key to detect inserts and updates but not deletes. Whereas log-based replication uses the
      database’s binary log files to detect records that have been inserted, updated, or deleted.
      Supporting this capability, where applicable, means that targets have the information it needs
      to delete records in the destination.

      <h4>Test</h4>
      This capability is still in development, but the goal is to make it easy for connector
      developers to test locally without having to make a connection to the source systems. This
      might be accomplished by implementing utilities that can generate and save test data or make
      saving and moving real HTTP requests for tests easier. Join the issue conversation here!

      <h3>Target Specific</h3>
      <h4>Soft Delete</h4>
      <p>
        Targets that support this capability implement logic that soft deletes records in the
        destination, usually by populating a deleted_at timestamp field. The two common techniques
        for handling deletes in Singer are by using the ACTIVATE_VERSION message or using log-based
        replication on a database that supports it. Targets commonly implement both soft and hard
        deletes, in which case the behavior is configurable in the target’s config settings.
      </p>

      <h4>Hard Delete</h4>
      <p>
        Similar to the Soft Deletes capability, targets that support the hard delete capability
        implement logic that removes records from the destination when they receive a notification
        (via ACTIVATE_VERSION or log-based replication) that a record was deleted from the source
        system. Targets commonly implement both soft and hard deletes, in which case the behavior is
        configurable in the target’s config settings.
      </p>

      <h4>Datatype Failsafe</h4>
      <p>
        This capability means that the target has a failsafe data type (e.g. string) to ensure safe
        handling of unparsable or unforseen types. It’s common to find targets in the Singer
        ecosystem that have a set list of supported types and will throw an exception if they
        receive anything unexpected. With this capability supported you can feel comfortable that
        exceptions will not be raised for unsupported types.
      </p>

      <h4>Record Flattening</h4>
      <p>
        It’s common for taps to output nested json data which needs to be flattened by the target in
        order to be loaded into a columnar format destinations. For example, the following is a
        nested json record:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
{
  "col_a": {
    "subcol_1": 1,
    "subcol_2": 2
  }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>After flattening it would look like the like this:</p>
      <pre><code>{
  "col_a__subcol_1": 1,
  "col_a__subcol_2": 2
}</code></pre>

      <p>
        Targets that support this capability also usually accept a configurable max_level of
        flattening to limit iterations of very heavily nested records.
      </p>

      <h3>Either Tap or Target</h3>
      <h4>Activate Version</h4>
      <p>
        Managing hard deletes in the source system is difficult but the Singer community has
        developed a technique using a message type called ACTIVATE_VERSION. This isnt a standardized
        message type in the Singer Spec yet but its currently under review by the Singer Working
        Group to be officially added. Join the issue conversation here!
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine the scenario where a key-based incremental sync has completed its initial load and a
        state bookmark is saved to be used as a filter in the next incremental run. Then in the
        source system a record is hard deleted. On the next incremental sync the tap will have no
        way of knowing that record was deleted, resulting in stale records that only exist in the
        destination table.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple solution could be to run a full sync everytime and have the target truncate any old
        records. But the other challenge is that targets have no way of knowing what sync mode the
        tap is running in: full table, incremental, or log based. If the target knew that the tap
        was running in full table sync mode then it would be able to effectively truncate the
        existing data and replace it with the newest full sync it receives.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where the ACTIVATE_VERSION message comes in! The ACTIVATE_VERSION message type is a
        mechanism that is used in full table sync mode which tells the target to disregard all
        previously received records and only consider the current version as “active”. By using this
        mechanism the sync between the tap and target can properly delete inactive versions of the
        data in the destination to clean up any stale records that were hard deleted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taps that support this capability will send along and ACTIVATE_VERSION message (usually
        generated from the current timestamp) prior to sending the RECORD messages on the first full
        sync and then at the end of each subsequent successful full table sync thereafter. Targets
        that support this capability implement logic that removes all non-active records from the
        destination.
      </p>

      <h4>Stream Maps</h4>
      <p>
        The ability to accept a mapping configuration can be used to do minor transformations to the
        data between the tap and target. The capability can be currently be implemented on the tap
        or target side but will soon be supported in Meltano itself. This includes things like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>stream and property aliasing</li>
        <li>duplication and bifurcation of streams</li>
        <li>hashing or anonymizing PII/PHI</li>
        <li>row-level filtering</li>
        <li>suppression of streams or stream properties</li>
        <li>and more…</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Taps and targets that support this capability have logic to accept the optional stream_maps
        config key and do light transformations like those listed above. This is a built-in
        capability for SDK-based (>=0.3.0) taps and targets. See the SDK documentation here for more
        details and use cases.
      </p>

      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>
        The tap or target accepts an --about argument which outputs details about the connector
        including its capabilities and settings which can be used in programmatically generate UI
        forms. This information can be output in JSON or Markdown format.
      </p>

      <p>
        An example output in json format --about --format=json from target-athena built using the
        Meltano SDK for Singer:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
{
  "name": "target-athena",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "sdk_version": "0.3.9",
  "capabilities": [
    "target"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "s3_bucket": {
        "type": [
          "string"
        ]
      },
      ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

      <h4>Batch</h4>
      <p>
        This capability is currently in development by the Singer Working Group to align on a
        consistent approach for supporting batch sync messages in the Spec or as part of its
        officially supported patterns. The capability, which was inspired by Wise’s Fast Sync
        feature, has the goal of bypassing some of the performance limitations inherent to the
        Singer Spec by using the optimized import/export features of modern data warehouses
        (Snowflake, Redshift, etc.). For example if a tap and target both had batch support the tap
        could theoretically know to directly write records to csv files somewhere (i.e. S3) in an
        ideal format for the target to import, ultimately skipping most of the piping step. Taking
        this approach allows connectors to improve performance by both using the source and/or
        target’s most optimized technique for importing and exporting data while also avoiding the
        additional costs of serializing, deserializing, and piping each record. Join the issue
        conversation here!
      </p>

      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        MeltanoHub is built with every part of the Singer ecosystem and Meltano product family. This
        is a completely open source, end-to-end, production example of Meltano using full-featured
        Singer connectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use Meltano itself to pull data from GitHub. View the Meltano project for this effort in
        the Meltano Squared repository.
      </p>
      <p>We’re using Singer taps and targets to extract and load into a Snowflake warehouse.</p>
      <p>We’re using dbt to manage transformations with Athena to aid in curating the data.</p>

      <h2>Meltano Usage Metrics</h2>
      <p>
        Meltano collects anonymous usage stats using Google Analytics. We use this data to learn
        about the size of our user base and overal feature usage. This helps us determine the
        highest impact improvements we can make to Meltano and the Singer ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        To better support the Meltano and Singer communities, we have started aggregating metrics
        about the usage of taps and targets within Meltano. In line with our value of together we
        thrive, we are sharing this data with the communithy to help everyone better understand the
        overall quality of Singer connectors.
      </p>
      <p>Current Metrics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Executions (Last 3 Months): The sum of executions via meltano elt or meltano invoke) that
          used the plugin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Projects (Last 3 Months): The distinct count of project IDs that have executed the plugin
          at least once in the last 3 months.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that metrics will only show up on a plugin page if they’re non-zero.</p>
      <p>
        Currently these metrics do not take into account the specific variant of the plugin but
        rather an aggregation of all variants used under that plugin’s namespace. This is a
        limitation of the event data that’s being collected. For example, tap-gitlab has multiple
        variants (MeltanoLabs, singer-io, etc.) which are all rolled up into the parent tap-gitlab
        namespace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Meltano makes it easy for users to opt out of sending usage stats we assume that
        metrics are undercounted.
      </p>
      <p>

        aggregate these metrics.
