      Upload a logo image for the new plugin. The ideal image is an SVG or PNG, has no text over the logo, and has a transparent background.

      Sometimes and image already exists, for example if an extractor is listed on the MeltanoHub and you want to add a loader.
      In that case, you can leave a note of what existing plugin to use.

      Tip: You can attach images by clicking this area to highlight it and then dragging files in.
