## Getting Started

You can get started with GitLab Pages using Jekyll easily by either forking this repository or by uploading a new/existing Jekyll project.

Remember you need to wait for your site to build before you will be able to see your changes.  You can track the build on the **Pipelines** tab.

### Start by forking this repository

1. Fork this repository.
1. **IMPORTANT:** Remove the fork relationship.
Go to **Settings (⚙)** > **Edit Project** and click the **"Remove fork relationship"** button.
1. Enable Shared Runners.
Go to **Settings (⚙)** > **Pipelines** and click the **"Enable shared Runners"** button.
1. Rename the repository to match the name you want for your site.
1. Edit your website through GitLab or clone the repository and push your changes.

### Start from a local Jekyll project

1. [Install][] Jekyll.
1. Use `jekyll new` to create a new Jekyll Project.
1. Add [this `.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml) to the root of your project.
1. Push your repository and changes to GitLab.

## GitLab CI

This project's static Pages are built by [GitLab CI][ci], following the steps
defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml):

```
image: ruby:2.3

variables:
  JEKYLL_ENV: production

pages:
  script:
  - bundle install
  - bundle exec jekyll build -d public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master
```

## Using Jekyll locally

To work locally with this project, you'll have to follow the steps below:

1. Fork, clone or download this project
1. [Install][] Jekyll
1. Download dependencies: `bundle`
1. Build and preview: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
1. Add content

The above commands should be executed from the root directory of this project.

Read more at Jekyll's [documentation][].

## GitLab User or Group Pages

To use this project as your user/group website, you will need one additional
step: just rename your project to `namespace.gitlab.io`, where `namespace` is
your `username` or `groupname`. This can be done by navigating to your
project's **Settings**.

Read more about [user/group Pages][userpages] and [project Pages][projpages].

## Did you fork this project?

If you forked this project for your own use, please go to your project's
**Settings** and remove the forking relationship, which won't be necessary
unless you want to contribute back to the upstream project.

## Other examples

* [jekyll-branched](https://gitlab.com/pages/jekyll-branched) demonstrates how you can keep your GitLab Pages site in one branch and your project's source code in another.
* The [jekyll-themes](https://gitlab.com/groups/jekyll-themes) group contains a collection of example projects you can fork (like this one) having different visual styles.

## Troubleshooting

1. CSS is missing! That means two things:
    * Either that you have wrongly set up the CSS URL in your templates, or
    * your static generator has a configuration option that needs to be explicitly
    set in order to serve static assets under a relative URL.
