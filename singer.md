## Meltano's Commitment to the Singer Community

We aim to make the MeltanoHub a fantastic resource for members of the [Singer](https://singer.io) Community.
As we've detailed in the Meltano handbook, we're fully [embracing Singer](https://meltano.com/docs/#embracing-singer) and this part of the MeltanoHub is part of those efforts.

### Standardized Taps and Targets

We're working to define a standard JSON Schema for all Singer-compatible taps and targets.
We've started by converting all taps and targets compatible with Meltano to a clean YAML format that has no references to Meltano itself.
Our expectation is that other tools can utilize these definitions to build their own library of Singer-compatible taps and targets.

All taps and targets available through the MeltanoHub are listed here:

* [Singer Taps](/singer/taps/)
* [Singer Targets](/singer/targets/)

Each tap and target is defined in YAML and is validated against a JSON Schema available on [this site](/singer/schema.json).
The JSON Schema will continue to evolve as we iterate towards a formal launch of the MeltanoHub, after which there will be strong versioning.

We've also compiled all taps and targets into their own JSON files for use by anyone.
These are available here:

* [Tap JSON](/singer/taps.json)
* [Target JSON](/singer/targets.json)

Individual JSON files are also available through the individual pages or on the [repository](https://gitlab.com/meltano/hub/) building the MeltanoHub.

### Tap and Target SDKs

We've also created an [SDK for Singer Taps](https://gitlab.com/meltano/singer-sdk) that is the best way to build and maintain Singer-compatible taps.
We're actively working on an [SDK for Singer Targets](https://gitlab.com/groups/meltano/-/epics/91) due to be launched in May 2021.

Read more about the [launch of the SDK on our blog](https://meltano.com/blog/2021/04/05/meltano-launches-v0-1-0-of-the-singer-tap-sdk/).

### Singer Spec

We've created a simplified version of the Singer Specification available at [here](/singer/spec).
