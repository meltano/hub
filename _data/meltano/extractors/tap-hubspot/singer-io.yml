    This is the Hubspot API Key provided by HubSpot.

    As an alternative to OAuth 2.0 authentication during development, you may specify
    this setting to authenticate with the HubSpot API. This should be used only for
    low-volume development work, as the
    [HubSpot API Usage Guidelines](https://developers.hubspot.com/apps/api_guidelines)
    specify that integrations should use OAuth for authentication.

    Any OAuth authentication parameters will be ignored if this key is present!
