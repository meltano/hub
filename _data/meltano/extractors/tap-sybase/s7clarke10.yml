- description: To emit a date as a date without a time component or time without an
    UTC offset. This is helpful to avoid time conversions or to just work with a date
    datetype in the target database. If this boolean config item is not set, the default
    behaviour is `false` i.e. emit date datatypes as a datetime. It is recommended
    to set this on if you have time datetypes and are having issues uploading into
    into a target database.

- description: Set the version of TDS to use when communicating with Sybase Server

    from Sybase databases. See the pymssql documentation and FreeTDS documentation
    for more  details.

- description: "The characterset for the database / source system. The default is\
    \ `utf8`, however older databases might use a charactersets like cp1252 for the\
    \ encoding. If you have errors with a UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't\
    \ decode byte .... then a solution is examine the characterset of the source database\
    \ / system and make an appropriate substitution for utf8 like cp1252."

- description: To make use of fetchmany(x) instead of fetchone(), use cursor_array_size
    with an integer value indicating the number of rows to pull. This can help in
    some architectures by pulling more rows into memory. The default if omitted is
    1, the tap will still use fetchmany, but with an argument of 1, under the assumption
    that  like cp1252.

- description: To emit all numeric values as strings and treat floats as string data
