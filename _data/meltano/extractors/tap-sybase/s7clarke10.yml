- description: "The characterset for the database / source system. The default is
    `utf8`, however older databases might use a charactersets like cp1252 for the
    encoding. If you have errors with a UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode
    byte .... Then a solution is examine the characterset of the source database /
    system and make an appropriate substitution for utf8 like cp1252."
  kind: string
  label: Characterset
  name: characterset
  value: utf8
- description: To make use of fetchmany(x) instead of fetchone(), use cursor_array_size
    with an integer value indicating the number of rows to pull. This can help in
    some architectures by pulling more rows into memory. The default if omitted is
    1, the tap will still use fetchmany, but with an argument of 1, under the assumption
    that fetchmany(1)==fetchone().
  kind: integer
  label: Cursor Array Size

- description: To filter the discovery to a particular schema within a database. This
    is useful if you have a large number of schemas and wish to speed up the discovery.

- description: Set the version of TDS to use when communicating with Sybase Server
    (the default is None). This is used by pymssql with connecting and fetching data
    from Sybase databases. See the pymssql documentation and FreeTDS documentation
    for more details.
  kind: string
  label: Tds Version
  name: tds_version
- description: To emit a date as a date without a time component or time without an
    UTC offset. This is helpful to avoid time conversions or to just work with a date
    datetype in the target database. If this boolean config item is not set, the default
    behaviour is `false` i.e. emit date datatypes as a datetime. It is recommended
    to set this on if you have time datetypes and are having issues uploading into
    into a target database.
  kind: boolean
  label: Use Date Datatype
  name: use_date_datatype
  value: false
- description: To emit all numeric values as strings and treat floats as string data
    types for the target, set use_singer_decimal to true. The resulting SCHEMA message
    will contain an attribute in additionalProperties containing the scale and precision
    of the discovered property. We recommend setting this value to `true` for accurate
    ingestion of floats and decimal data.
