  label: Aspects
  description: An option you will find in the API documentation but setting this to
    'true' has caused issues (in my experience) whereby some data points are no longer
    provided in the returning payload. Not many BLS series include this. See [the BLS website](https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm#parameters)
    for more details.
  kind: boolean
- name: annualaverage
  label: Annual Average
  description: If selected, an annual data series will include a M13 datapoint with
    the annual average value. See [the BLS website](https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm#parameters)
    for more details.
  kind: boolean

    to the current year.

  label: Start Year
  description: 'the year you want your data extract to start. Not the limits: you
    can pull up to 20 years in one go, and most data seris start at 2000, so you do
    the math... If left blank it will default to 2000.'
  kind: date_iso8601
- name: calculations
  label: Calculations
  description: Provides 1,3,6 and 12 month changes in the data in both net and percentage
    format. If selected, these 6 additional datapoints will be included in separate
    columns. See [the BLS website](https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm#parameters)
    for more details.
  kind: boolean
