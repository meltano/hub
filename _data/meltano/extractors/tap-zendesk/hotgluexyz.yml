  ### Sideloading for Tickets

  Sideloading is a functionality provided by Zendesk to fetch related records in a single request more detail - https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/ticketing/using-the-zendesk-api/side_loading/

  There are two ways in which the records are returned:

    * Within the same object as a column
    * As a separate object

  Here we have provided support for sideloading only the 1st type i.e. the attributes returned in the same object as additional columns

  Sideload supported for tickets:

    *  comment_count
    *  dates
    *  metric_sets
    *  slas

  To sideload an object a list can be passed in the [metadata extra](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#metadata-extra) under `sideload-objects``:

  ```
  extractors:
  - name: tap-zendesk
    metadata:
      tickets:
        sideload-objects:
          - comment_count
          - dates
          - metric_events
          - slas
  ```
variant: hotgluexyz
