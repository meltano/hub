  ### Authentication Setup Details
  The tap uses a LinkedIn provided access_token in the config settings to make API requests. Access tokens expire after 60 days and require a user to manually authenticate again. If the tap receives a 401 invalid token response, the error logs will state that your access token has expired and to re-authenticate your connection to generate a new token. This is described more in LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 Docs.

  The API user account should be assigned one of the following roles:

  - ACCOUNT_BILLING_ADMIN
  - ACCOUNT_MANAGER
  - CAMPAIGN_MANAGER
  - CREATIVE_MANAGER
  - VIEWER (Recommended)

  The API user account should be assigned the following permissions for the API endpoints:

  - accounts, account_users, video_ads, campaign_groups, campaigns, creatives:
    - r_ads: read ads (Recommended)
    - rw_ads: read-write ads
  - ad_analytics_by_campaign, ad_analytics_by_creative:
    - r_ads_reporting: read ads reporting

  NOTE: Legacy permissions (r_ad_campaigns) have been migrated to the new permissions (r_ads and r_ads_reporting) based on this permissions mapping.

  To generate the access_token:

  1. Login to LinkedIn as the API user.
  2. Create an [API App](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps) here:
    - App Name: tap-linkedin-ads
    - Company: search and find your company LinkedIn page
    - Privacy policy URL: link to company privacy policy
    - Business email: developer/admin email address
    - App logo: Stitch (or Company) logo
    - Products: Select Marketing Developer Platform (checkbox)
    - Review/agree to legal terms and create app
  3. Verify App:
    - Provide the verify URL to your Company's LinkedIn Admin to verify and authorize the app.
    - Once verified, select the [App in the Console here](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
    - Review the “Auth” tab:
    - Record client_id and client_secret (for later steps).
    - Review permissions and ensure app has the permissions (above).
    - Oauth 2.0 settings: Provide a redirect_uri (for later steps): https://www.google.com
    - Review the “Products” tab and ensure “Marketing Developer Platform” has been added and approved (listed in the “added products” section).
    - Review the “Usage & limits” tab. This shows the daily application and user/member limits with percent used for each resource endpoint.
  4. Authorize App: The authorization token lasts 60-days before expiring. The tap app will need to be reauthorized when the authorization token expires.
    - Create an Authorization URL with the following pattern
      - Create a random alphanumeric state_key (used to prevent [CRSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)).
      - URL pattern: Provide the scope from permissions above (with + delimiting each permission) and replace the other highlighted parameters: https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&scope=YOUR_PERMISSIONS_SCOPE&state=YOUR_STATE_KEY
    - In web browser, navigate to Authorization URL.
    - Once redirected, click “Allow” to authorize app.
    - The browser will be redirected to the redirect_uri. Record the code parameter listed in the redirect URL in the Browser header URL.
  5. Run the following curl command with the parameters replaced to return your access_token. The access_token expires in 2-months.
    ```bash
    > curl -0 -v -X POST https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken\
      -H "Accept: application/json"\
      -H "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"\
      -d "grant_type=authorization_code"\
      -d "code=YOUR_CODE"\
      -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID"\
      -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"\
      -d "state=YOUR_STATE_KEY"\
      -d "redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
    ```
