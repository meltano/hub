    The prefered replication method.

    Note:
    - Key-based incremental (`INCREMENTAL`) requires configuring a `replication_key` column within the
      catalog's stream definitions for each supported stream.
    - Requirements and setup instructions for log-based incremental (`LOG_BASED`) are documented
      [here](https://github.com/transferwise/pipelinewise-tap-postgres#log-based-replication-requirements).

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Error: `pg_config executable not found` or `libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory`

  This error message indicates that the [`libpq`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) dependency is missing.
