  #### Known limitations

  Note that the Start Date is not available as the API does not support incremental replication.

  Zoom also appears to "expire" meetings and webinars over time, making them unavailable to the API. Make sure your data lands in a trusted destination, as it may be the only place it eventually becomes available.
