  label: State Message Threshold
  kind: integer
  value: 1000
  description: |
    Used to throttle how often STATE messages are generated when the tap is using the “REST” API.

    This is a balance between not slowing down execution due to too many STATE messages produced and how many records must be fetched again if a tap fails unexpectedly. Defaults to 1000 (generate a STATE message every 1000 records).
