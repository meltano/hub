- description: The size of the time window to query by, default 3,600 seconds (i.e.
    1 hour). If the result set for a batch is greater than the max limit of 10,000
    records then the tap will query the same window again where >= the most recent
    record received. This means that the same data is potentially being scanned >1
    times but < 2 times, depending on the amount the results set went over the 10k
    max. For example a batch window with 15k records would scan the 15k once, receiving
    10k results, then scan ~5k again to get the rest. The net result is the same data
    was scanned ~1.5 times for that batch. To avoid this you should set the batch
    window to avoid exceeding the 10k limit.
