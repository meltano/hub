    #### How to get

    The process for getting the private token or personal access token is very simple:

    <video controls style="max-width: 100%">
      <source src="/assets/videos/tap-gitlab/personal-access-token.mov">
    </video>

    1. Navigate to your [profile's access tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens).

    2. Fill out the personal access token form with the following properties:

    - **Name:** meltano-gitlab-tutorial
    - **Expires:** _leave blank unless you have a specific reason to expire the token_
    - **Scopes:**
      - api

    3. Click on `Create personal access token` to submit your request.

    4. You should see your token appear at the top of your screen. It should look something like this: `I8vxHsiVAaDnAX3hA`

    This property allows you to scope data that the extractor fetches to only the desired group. The group name can generally be found at the root of a repository's URL. If this is left blank, you have to at least provide a [project](#projects).

    Leave empty if you'd like to pull data from a project in a personal user namespace.

    For example, `https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-gitlab` has a group of `meltano`.

    Multiple group names can be separated using space characters.

    This property allows you to scope the project(s) that the extractor fetches.

    Leave empty if you've specified one or more [groups](#groups) and would like to pull data from all projects inside these groups.

    The format for it is `namespace/project`, where namespace can be a username or group name. Here are a couple examples:

    - `meltano/meltano` - The core [Meltano project](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano)
    - `meltano/sdk` - The project for the [Meltano SDK for Singer Taps and Targets ](https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk)

    Multiple group paths can be separated using space characters.

    For each Merge Request, also fetch the MR's commits and create the join table `merge_request_commits` with the Merge Request and related Commit IDs.

    This can slow down extraction considerably because of the many API calls required.

    The `merge_request_commits` entity cannot be [selected](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#selecting-entities-and-attributes-for-extraction) unless this setting is enabled.

    For every Pipeline, also fetch extended details of each of these pipelines.

    This  can slow down extraction considerably because of the many API calls required.
