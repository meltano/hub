    #### How to get

    The process for getting the private token or personal access token is very simple:

    <video controls style="max-width: 100%">
      <source src="/assets/videos/tap-gitlab/personal-access-token.mov">
    </video>

    1. Navigate to your [profile's access tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens).

    2. Fill out the personal access token form with the following properties:

    - **Name:** meltano-gitlab-tutorial
    - **Expires:** _leave blank unless you have a specific reason to expire the token_
    - **Scopes:**
      - api

    3. Click on `Create personal access token` to submit your request.

    4. You should see your token appear at the top of your screen. It should look something like this: `I8vxHsiVAaDnAX3hA`
- name: groups
  env_aliases:
  - GITLAB_API_GROUPS
  value: ''
  label: Groups
  description: |
    This property allows you to scope data that the extractor fetches to only the desired group. The group name can generally be found at the root of a repository's URL. If this is left blank, you have to at least provide a [project](#projects).

    Leave empty if you'd like to pull data from a project in a personal user namespace.

    For example, `https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-gitlab` has a group of `meltano`.

    Multiple group names can be separated using space characters.
  placeholder: Ex. my-organization
- name: projects
  env_aliases:
  - GITLAB_API_PROJECTS
  value: ''
  label: Project
  description: |
    This property allows you to scope the project(s) that the extractor fetches.

    Leave empty if you've specified one or more [groups](#groups) and would like to pull data from all projects inside these groups.

    The format for it is `namespace/project`, where namespace can be a username or group name. Here are a couple examples:

    - `meltano/meltano` - The core [Meltano project](https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano)
    - `meltano/sdk` - The project for the [Meltano SDK for Singer Taps and Targets ](https://gitlab.com/meltano/sdk)

    Multiple group paths can be separated using space characters.

    Enable to pull in extra data (like Epics, Epic Issues and other entities)
    only available to GitLab Ultimate and GitLab.com Gold accounts.

    The `epics` and `epic_issues` entities cannot be [selected](https://docs.meltano.com/integration.html#selecting-entities-and-attributes-for-extraction) unless this setting is enabled.
- name: fetch_merge_request_commits
  label: Fetch Merge Request Commits
  kind: boolean
  value: false
  description: |
    For each Merge Request, also fetch the MR's commits and create the join table `merge_request_commits` with the Merge Request and related Commit IDs.

    This can slow down extraction considerably because of the many API calls required.

    The `merge_request_commits` entity cannot be [selected](https://docs.meltano.com/integration.html#selecting-entities-and-attributes-for-extraction) unless this setting is enabled.
- name: fetch_pipelines_extended
  label: Fetch Pipelines Extended
  kind: boolean
  value: false
  description: |
    For every Pipeline, also fetch extended details of each of these pipelines.

    This  can slow down extraction considerably because of the many API calls required.

    The `pipelines_extended` entity cannot be [selected](https://docs.meltano.com/integration.html#selecting-entities-and-attributes-for-extraction) unless this setting is enabled.

    that the larger the time period and amount of data, the longer the initial extraction
    can be expected to take.
