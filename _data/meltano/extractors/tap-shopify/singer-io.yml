    #### How to get

    ##### Create private app

    First, you will need to create a [Private App](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/private-apps):

    1. Log in to your Shopify store admin at `https://<store subdomain>.myshopify.com/admin`
    2. Click "Apps" in the sidebar on the left
    3. On the bottom of the page, click "Manage private apps" next to "Working with a developer on your shop?"
    4. Click the "Create a new private app" button
    5. Enter a "Private app name" of your choosing, e.g. "Meltano"
    6. Enter your email address under "Emergency developer email"
    7. In the "Admin API" section, click "â–¼ Review disabled Admin API permissions"
    8. Choose "Read access" rather than "No access" in the access level dropdowns for the following permissions:
      1. Products, variants and collections - `read_products, write_products`
      2. Orders, transactions and fulfillments - `read_orders, write_orders`
      3. Customer details and customer groups - `read_customers, write_customers`
    9. Click "Save"
    10. In the modal that appears, click "I understand, create the app"

    ##### Find your API password

    Now that your app has been created, we can acquire the password Meltano will use to authenticate with the Shopify API.

    1. In the "Admin API" section on the private app details page, find the "Password" field and click "Show"
    2. The value that appears (starting with `shppa_`) is your API password. You can copy and paste it into the Meltano data source configuration.
