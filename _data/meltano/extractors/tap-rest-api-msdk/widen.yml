  ## Examples

  An example retrieving publicly available earthquake data is described in [this blog](https://engineering.widen.com/blog/Dagster-+-Meltano/).
  The configuration yaml for that API example should look like the following:

  ```yaml
  - name: tap-rest-api-msdk
    variant: widen
    pip_url: tap-rest-api-msdk
    config:
      api_url: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws
      streams:
      - name: us_earthquakes
        params:
          format: geojson
          starttime: '2022-12-07'
          endtime: '2022-12-08'
          minmagnitude: 1
        path: /event/1/query
        primary_keys:
        - id
        records_path: $.features[*]
        num_inference_records: 200
    select:
    - '*.*'
  ```
variant: widen
