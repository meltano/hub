    method.

- description: (optional) an object of headers to pass into the api calls.

- description: (optional) a jsonpath string representing the path in the requests
    response that contains the records to process. Defaults to `$[*]`.

- description: This tap automatically flattens the entire json structure and builds
    keys based on the corresponding paths. Keys, whether composite or otherwise, listed
    in this dictionary will not be recursively flattened, but instead their values
    will be turned into a json string and processed in that format. This is also automatically
    done for any lists within the records; therefore, records are not duplicated for
    each item in lists.
  label: Except Keys
  name: except_keys
- description: (optional) number of records used to infer the stream's schema. Defaults
    to 50.
