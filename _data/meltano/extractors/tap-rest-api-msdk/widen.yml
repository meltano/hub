    An array of streams, designed for separate paths using thesame base url.

    Stream level config options.

    Parameters that appear at the stream-level will overwrite their top-level counterparts except where noted below:

    - name: required: name of the stream.
    - path: optional: the path appended to the api_url.
    - params: optional: an object of objects that provide the params in a requests.get method. Stream level params will be merged with top-level params with stream level params overwriting top-level params with the same key.
    - headers: optional: an object of headers to pass into the api calls. Stream level headers will be merged with top-level params with stream level params overwriting top-level params with the same key
    - records_path: optional: a jsonpath string representing the path in the requests response that contains the records to process. Defaults to $[*].
    - primary_keys: required: a list of the json keys of the primary key for the stream.
    - replication_key: optional: the json key of the replication key. Note that this should be an incrementing integer or datetime object.
    - except_keys: This tap automatically flattens the entire json structure and builds keys based on the corresponding paths.

    - num_inference_keys: optional: number of records used to infer the stream's schema. Defaults to 50.
    - schema: optional: A valid Singer schema or a path-like string that provides the path to a .json file that contains a valid Singer schema. If provided, the schema will not be inferred from the results of an api call.

  ## Examples

  An example retrieving publicly available earthquake data is described in [this blog](https://engineering.widen.com/blog/Dagster-+-Meltano/).
  The configuration yaml for that API example should look like the following:

  ```yaml
  - name: tap-rest-api-msdk
    variant: widen
    pip_url: tap-rest-api-msdk
    config:
      api_url: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws
      streams:
      - name: us_earthquakes
        params:
          format: geojson
          starttime: '2022-12-07'
          endtime: '2022-12-08'
          minmagnitude: 1
        path: /event/1/query
        primary_keys:
        - id
        records_path: $.features[*]
        num_inference_records: 200
    select:
    - '*.*'
  ```
variant: widen
