  As the Harvest Forecast API is [not yet public](https://help.getharvest.com/forecast/faqs/faq-list/api/), this tap is experimental and liable to break at any time. Please keep this in mind if you run into any issues (and submit a PR if you can fix something broken).

  ### Retrieve Auth Credentials

  Visit the [developer tools](https://id.getharvest.com/developers) page on Harvest's website and create a new oauth token.

  Paste the Client ID you got from the above page in the url of a browser like https://id.getharvest.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id={OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code. Now you're able to login, click 'authorize app' and then are redirected to a url like this https://id.getharvest.com/oauth2/authorize?code={OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN}&scope=all. You will use this OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN in the following step to configure the oauth application.
