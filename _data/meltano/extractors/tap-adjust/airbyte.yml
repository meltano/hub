  ## Airbyte Preview Warning

  This connector uses [tap-airbyte](/extractors/airbyte) to call the underlying Docker container for the source. This means the following is required prior to usage:
    
    1. You must have Docker installed and running.
    1. You must have tap-airbyte installed

  For more context on how this Airbyte integration works please checkout out the [FAQ in the Meltano Docs](https://docs.meltano.com).

  ## Required Configuration

  Run these two commands prior to attempting to use the connector:

  ```
  meltano config <tap-name> set airbyte_spec.image airbyte/<docker-tag> 

  meltano config <tap-name> set airbyte_spec.tag latest
  ```

  Your `meltano.yml` for this connector should having this block present after configuration:
    
  ```yaml
  config:
    airbyte_spec:
      image: "airbyte/<docker-tag>"
      tag: "latest"
  ```

  From there, you will be able to configure the rest of the settings.
