  This tap has default selection criteria to exclude streams that have custom logic in them.
  This is because the tap developers have a use case that requires them to query their data
  warehouse prior to running replication for a few of the streams. Since this logic is hard
  coded for their particular use case, those streams should be excluded by default for anyone
  else using the tap.

  See https://github.com/voxmedia/tap-facebook-pages/issues/8 for more details.
