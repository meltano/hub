    In AWS DocumentDB (unlike MongoDB), change streams must be enabled specifically (see
    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/change_streams.html#change_streams-enabling
    ). If attempting to open a change stream against a collection on which change streams have not been
    enabled, an OperationFailure error will be raised. If this property is set to True, when this error
    is seen, the tap will execute an admin command to enable change streams and then retry the read
    operation. Note: if this setting is enabled, the credential the tap is using must have the `modifyChangeStreams`
    permission. Second note: use of this setting, and of change streams in general, may incur additional costs in
    AWS DocumentDB.

settings_preamble: |
  This tap supports incremental replication and log-based replication - log-based replication leverages the
  MongoDB/DocumentDB Change Streams API. You will need to indicate the replication strategy in your meltano.yml file.

  To enable incremental replication:
  ```yaml
  metadata:
    '*':
      replication-key: _id
      replication-method: INCREMENTAL
  ```

  To enable log-based replication:
  ```yaml
  metadata:
    '*':
      replication-key: _id
      replication-method: LOG_BASED
  ```

  Note that the tap currently only supports the replication key `_id` - the tap assumes that every collection in the
  database has an [ObjectId](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/reference/bson-types/#objectid) field named `_id`, and
  that that field is indexed. If this is not true of your database, please open an issue with the tap.

  Individual database collections may be selected using standard Meltano catalog selection. Note, though, that the
  field values which may be selected are not the fields on the database document, but rather the fields on the schema
  used by this tap. That is, while it is possible for example to opt out of the `ns` field:
  ```yaml
  select:
    - '!*.ns`
  ```
  the `document` field will always contain the entirety of the database document. This is true for log-based replication
  as well, as the change stream in that case is opened with the option `full_document="updateLookup"`. If you would
  prefer different behavior, please open an issue with the tap.
