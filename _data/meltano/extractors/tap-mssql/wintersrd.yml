    The characterset for the database / source system. The default is utf8, however older databases might use a charactersets like cp1252 for the encoding.
    If you have errors with a UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte .... then a solution is to examine the characterset of the source database / system
    and make an appropriate substitution for utf8 like cp1252.
