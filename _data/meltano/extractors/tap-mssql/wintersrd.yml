    If this boolean config item is not set, the default behaviour is false i.e. emit date datatypes as a datetime.
    It is recommended to set this on if you have time datatypes and are having issues uploading into into a target database.

  label: Characterset
  description: |
    The characterset for the database / source system. The default is utf8, however older databases might use a charactersets like cp1252 for the encoding.
    If you have errors with a UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte .... then a solution is to examine the characterset of the source database / system
    and make an appropriate substitution for utf8 like cp1252.
