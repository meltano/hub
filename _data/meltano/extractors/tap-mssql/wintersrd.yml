    The characterset for the database / source system. The default is utf8, however older databases might use a charactersets like cp1252 for the encoding.
    If you have errors with a UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte .... then a solution is to examine the characterset of the source database / system
    and make an appropriate substitution for utf8 like cp1252.

    The "conn_properties" allows specific configuration of database settings via SQL set statements to send to the database
    instance upon connection establishment. Can be a string or another kind of iterable of strings.
    If you want to connect Azure SQL Server instances e.g. PDW you will need to adjust the connection setting for that version of MSSQL.
    Please refer to the github repo page for details on these settings.
