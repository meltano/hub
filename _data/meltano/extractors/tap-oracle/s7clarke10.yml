    To avoid problems with uncommitted changes being read, you can set offset_value to add to the value found in the STATE for INCREMENTAL loads.
    If the value provided is for a datetime replication key then the offset_value is read as seconds to offset by, otherwise the value is used as provided.
    Using offset_value < 0 would result in an overlapping set of records being read each time the tap is run.
    Using offset_value > 0 may result in data being missed. However it can be useful if a period (month-year) is being used.
    This prevents the tap from using period >= last-read-period and doubling up on the extract.
    Usage (offsetting by +1 day in seconds = 24*3600).
