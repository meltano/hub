  label: Chats Full Sync Days
  description: The amount of days between full syncs of chats. This allows you to configure
    the tap to re-sync all chats every so many number of days. This exists due to the options
    (or lack thereof) the Zendesk Chat API provides when syncing chats. Each chat has an "end
    timestamp" that indicates when the chat was "ended." However, even after the chat has ended,
    it may be modified. In order to not sync all of the chats during every run of the tap, the
    tap filters data based on the "end timestamp." But this means if the chat is modified after
    the tap has already synced it, any modifications will be missed by the tap. By re-syncing
    every N days, you are able to update any chats that may have changed since they were synced
    by the tap. Defaults to None, meaning don't full sync regularly.
