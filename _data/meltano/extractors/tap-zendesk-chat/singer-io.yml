- description: The amount of days between full syncs of chats. This allows you to
    configure the tap to re-sync all chats every so many number of days. This exists
    due to the options (or lack thereof) the Zendesk Chat API provides when syncing
    chats. Each chat has an "end timestamp" that indicates when the chat was "ended."
    However, even after the chat has ended, it may be modified. In order to not sync
    all of the chats during every run of the tap, the tap filters data based on the
    "end timestamp." But this means if the chat is modified after the tap has already
    synced it, any modifications will be missed by the tap. By re-syncing every N
    days, you are able to update any chats that may have changed since they were synced
    by the tap. Defaults to None, meaning don't full sync regularly.
