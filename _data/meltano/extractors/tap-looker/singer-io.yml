  ### Additional Notes
  This tap uses Looker's API v3.1 https://developers.looker.com/api/explorer/3.1.

  - All endpoints replicate FULL_TABLE (ALL records, every time). Currently, the Looker API does not support paginating, sorting, filtering, or providing audit fields (like created/modified datetimes).
  - Primary Key field(s): Almost all endpoint have an id primary key
    - lookml_models, models, git_branches use a combination key of name and project_name
    - git_branches use a combination key of name and project_id
    - project_files use id and project_id
    - connections use name
    - user_attribute_values use user_id and user_attribute_id
    - group_attribute_values use group_id and attribute_value_id
  - Transformations: Remove can nodes; IDs to string; fix JSON validation errors (datatypes)
  - ALL JSON schema generated from Looker API Swagger Definitions
