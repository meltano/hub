  #### Creating the Tap-Slack App

  In order to access the records in your workspace, you will need to create a [new Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1).
  Below is an example App Manifest that you can use for your workspace.
  If you would like to access additional channels, such as direct messages, you will need to provide additional scopes to your Slack app.

  ```yaml
  _metadata:
    major_version: 1
    minor_version: 1
  display_information:
    name: MeltanoLabs Tap-Slack
    description: Slack App to support the implementation of Singer.io tap-slack
    long_description: This application is used for extracting channel, user, and message data from the Slack workspace via the tap-slack application. Found on GitHub at https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/tap-slack.
  features:
    bot_user:
      display_name: MeltanoLabs Tap-Slack
      always_online: false
  oauth_config:
    redirect_urls:
      - https://meltano.com/
    scopes:
      bot:
        - channels:join
        - channels:history
        - channels:read
        - users:read
        - users:read.email
  settings:
    org_deploy_enabled: false
    socket_mode_enabled: false
    token_rotation_enabled: false
  ```

  Once you receive an API key you can test that it has proper access to your Slack app using the following curl command.

  ```bash
  curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Your Token>' https://slack.com/api/conversations.list?exclude_archived=False
  ```
