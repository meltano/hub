  is an adapter-specific dbt [transformer](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#transformers) for running SQL-based transformations on data stored in your warehouse.

  This utility plugin is meant to be used in favor of the [dbt-postgres transformer plugin type](/transformers/dbt-postgres).

  Settings for dbt itself can be configured through [dbt_project.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml) as usual, which can be found at transform/dbt_project.yml in your Meltano project.  dbt also has [adapter-specific documentation for PostgreSQL](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/postgres-configs).
