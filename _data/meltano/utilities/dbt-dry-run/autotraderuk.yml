  dbt-dry-run is a meltano plugin based on the awesome tool created by the team at AutoTraderUk.
  It allows dbt-bigquery users to validate if their models will run (without encuring costs).
  It leverages bigquery's [dry-run](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dry-run-queries) feature.

  **A note**
  This plugin is at it's most powerful (in our opinion) in CI (we use github actions). It allows us to ensure that our changes will not break production.

next_steps: |
  To run this plugin for the first time, simply specify you DBT_BIGQUERY_PROFILES_DIR, DBT_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_DIR and DBT_DRY_RUN_TARGET.
  You will also need to compile your dbt models using the command `dbt-bigquery compile`.

  To run your plugin, you will need to define a target as well. We propose to easily to this by creating this custom command:
  ```
  commands:
  run:
    args:
      --target ${DBT_DRY_RUN_TARGET}
      --verbose

      Allows you to run the plugin. Requires that you specify a profile target.
      Note - Requires you run `dbt-bigquery compile` before executing.
    executable: dbt_dry_run_invoker
    ``` which will allow you to run the plugin at the specified target profile.


  Once this is done, simply run `dbt-dry-run:run` and watch the magic happen!
