  1. If you're running Superset for the first time in a new environment, generate a new [`SECRET_KEY`](#secret-key) to increase security:

     ```sh
     meltano config superset set SECRET_KEY $(openssl rand -base64 42)
     ```
  1. Create an admin user: (use `admin` as username to be able to load the examples)

     ```sh
     meltano invoke superset:create-admin
     ```

     This is equivalent to `superset fab create-admin` in the Superset documentation

  1. Optionally, load some example data to play with:

     ```sh
     meltano invoke superset:load-examples
     ```

     This is equivalent to `superset load_examples` in the Superset documentation

  1. Launch the Superset UI and log in using the username/password you created:

     ```sh
     meltano invoke superset:ui
     ```

     By default, the UI will be available at at [`http://localhost:8088`](http://localhost:8088). You can change this using the `ui.bind_host` and `ui.port` settings documented below.

  #### Add additional database drivers

  Superset does not ship bundled with connectivity to databases, except for SQLite, which is part of the Python standard library. You’ll need to install the required packages for the database you want to use as your metadata database as well as the packages needed to connect to the databases you want to access through Superset.

  You can find the list of supported databases and the appropriate PyPI (pip) packages in the [Supported Databases and Dependencies](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers#supported-databases-and-dependencies) section in the Superset documenation. These can then be added to your Meltano project by configuring
  a custom `pip_url` for the `superset` utility:

  1. Find the `superset` plugin definition in your `meltano.yml` project file
  2. Update the `pip_url` property to include the desired additional packages:

     ```yaml
     utilities:
     - name: superset
       variant: apache
       pip_url: apache-superset==1.5.0 markupsafe==2.0.1 cryptography==3.4.7 snowflake-sqlalchemy
     ```
  3. Re-install the plugin:

     ```sh
     meltano install utility superset
     ```

  Now when you (re)start Superset, you will be able to connect to a new type of database, like Snowflake in the example.
pip_url: apache-superset==1.5.0 markupsafe==2.0.1 cryptography==3.4.7

  #### Dependencies

  **The Superset plugin requires Meltano version 2.0.** If you're on an older version, make sure you update Meltano first.

  Once you have Meltano running, you likely already have everything you need for Superset as well.
  If you do run into trouble installing Superset following the instructions below, check out the [OS Dependencies](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-from-scratch/#os-dependencies) section in the Superset documentation.
  Note that the rest of that guide is not relevant if you're using Meltano to manage your Superset installation, initialization, and configuration.

  Meltano [centralizes the configuration](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/configuration) of all of the plugins in your project, including Superset's. This means that if the [Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset/) tells you to put something in `superset_config.py`, you can use `meltano config`, `meltano.yml`, or environment variables instead, and get the benefits of Meltano features like [environments](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/environments).

  Most settings (those with simple values like strings, integers, booleans, lists, or dictionaries) can be added directly to `meltano.yml`, manually or using `meltano config`. For example, `ROW_LIMIT = 5000` becomes `meltano config superset set ROW_LIMIT 5000` on the CLI, or `ROW_LIMIT: 5000` in `meltano.yml`. Just like in `superset_config.py`, config keys should be ALL_CAPS.

  #### Advanced configuration

  If you want to configure something more complex, like [custom OAuth2 configuration](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset/#custom-oauth2-configuration), you can add a `superset_config.py` file somewhere in your project, put your Superset config there exactly as the documentation suggests, and tell Meltano to pass that to Superset along with the Meltano-managed configuration by adding the `config_path` property to the `superset` plugin definition in `meltano.yml`:

  ```yaml
  utilities:
  - name: superset
    variant: apache
    pip_url: apache-superset==1.5.0
    config_path: analyze/superset/superset_config.py
    config:
      ROW_LIMIT: 5000
  ```

  Properties defined in your own `superset_config.py` take precedence over those managed by Meltano, like `ROW_LIMIT` in the example.

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Invalid decryption key

  If you see a `ValueError: Invalid decryption key` warning or a message that `Superset default roles and permissions could not be created: 'superset init' failed` then it's likely that your encryption key is incorrect.

  If you change your [`SECRET_KEY`](#secret-key), the metadata database containing your users and reports will become unreadable. If there was nothing valuable in there, you can delete it at `.meltano/utilities/superset/superset.db` inside your project. If you changed the secret key because the old one was leaked, you can [rotate the key](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset/#secret_key-rotation):

  ```bash
  meltano config superset set SECRET_KEY <new_key>
  meltano config superset set PREVIOUS_SECRET_KEY <original_key>
  meltano invoke superset re-encrypt-secrets
  ```
variant: apache
