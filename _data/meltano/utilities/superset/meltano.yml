next_steps: |
  1. If you're running Superset for the first time in a new environment you'll need to initialize the config, database, as well as generate generate a new [`SECRET_KEY`](#secret-key) to increase security:

    ```sh
    # create a new secret key
    meltano config superset set SECRET_KEY $(openssl rand -base64 42)
    # create the initial config, database, and auth roles.
    meltano invoke superset:initialize
    ```
  2. Create an admin user: (use `admin` as username to be able to load the examples)

    ```sh
    # add a superset admin using prompting for required values
    meltano invoke superset:create-admin
    ```

    This is equivalent to `superset fab create-admin` in the Superset documentation

  3. Optionally, load some example data to play with:

    ```sh
    meltano invoke superset:load-examples
    ```

    This is equivalent to `superset load_examples` in the Superset documentation

    **Note that you need a user named `admin` with the admin permissions to load these examples.**

  4. Launch the Superset UI and log in using the username/password you created:

    ```sh
    meltano invoke superset:ui
    ```

    By default, the UI will be available at at [`http://localhost:8088`](http://localhost:8088). You can change this using the `ui.bind_host` and `ui.port` settings documented below.

  #### Add additional database drivers

  Superset does not ship bundled with connectivity to databases, except for SQLite, which is part of the Python standard library. Youâ€™ll need to install the required packages for the database you want to use as your metadata database as well as the packages needed to connect to the databases you want to access through Superset.

  You can find the list of supported databases and the appropriate PyPI (pip) packages in the [Supported Databases and Dependencies](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/installing-database-drivers#supported-databases-and-dependencies) section in the Superset documenation. These can then be added to your Meltano project by configuring
  a custom `pip_url` for the `superset` utility:

  1. Find the `superset` plugin definition in your `meltano.yml` project file
  2. Update the `pip_url` property to include the desired additional packages:

     ```yaml
     utilities:
     - name: superset
       variant: apache
       pip_url: apache-superset==2.0.0 flask==2.0.3 werkzeug==2.0.3 jinja2==3.0.1 wtforms==2.3.3
         git+https://github.com/meltano/superset-ext.git@main cryptography==3.4.7
     ```
  3. Re-install the plugin:

     ```sh
     meltano install utility superset
     ```

  Now when you (re)start Superset, you will be able to connect to a new type of database, like Snowflake in the example.
pip_url: apache-superset==2.0.0 flask==2.0.3 werkzeug==2.0.3 jinja2==3.0.1 wtforms==2.3.3

    Superset metadata database connection string. Equivalent to the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` setting in `superset_config.py`.

    SQLite is used by default, but in production PostgreSQL or MySQL is more appropriate. See the [Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset/#using-a-production-metastore) for more information. To add a database driver like `psycopg2` or `mysqlclient`, refer to the [Add additional database drivers](#add-additional-database-drivers) section above.

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Invalid decryption key

  If you see a `ValueError: Invalid decryption key` warning or a message that `Superset default roles and permissions could not be created: 'superset init' failed` then it's likely that your encryption key is incorrect.

  If you change your [`SECRET_KEY`](#secret-key), the metadata database containing your users and reports will become unreadable. If there was nothing valuable in there, you can delete it at `.meltano/utilities/superset/superset.db` inside your project. If you changed the secret key because the old one was leaked, you can [rotate the key](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/configuring-superset/#secret_key-rotation):

  ```bash
  meltano config superset_ext set SECRET_KEY <new_key>
  meltano config superset_ext set PREVIOUS_SECRET_KEY <original_key>
  meltano invoke superset_ext re-encrypt-secrets
  ```
