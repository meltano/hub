  is an adapter-specific dbt [transformer](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#transformers) for running SQL-based transformations on data stored in your warehouse.

  This utility plugin is meant to be used in favor of the [dbt-duckdb transformer plugin type](/transformers/dbt-duckdb).
  Note that this plugin can only be run as part of an ELT pipeline with the `meltano run` command. If you are using `meltano elt` you should use the [transformer](/transformers/) plugins. We do recommend migrating to `meltano run` as the transformer plugin type will be deprecated in a future major Meltano release.

  1. If you're running dbt for the first time in a new environment:

    ```sh
    # create a starter dbt_project.yml file, a profiles.yml file, and models directory
    meltano invoke dbt-duckdb:initialize
    ```
