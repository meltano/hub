next_steps: |
  To start the Matatika Lab with your Meltano project, run:

  ```
  meltano invoke matatika lab
  ```

  If this is first time this command has been run, container images will be pulled from Docker Hub - be aware that this may take a couple of minutes, depending on the speed of your internet connection.
  Once the images exist on the host machine, start-up should take no longer than 30s.

  By default, a tab in your default browser will be opened to the Lab automatically at http://localhost:8080.
