  Settings for dbt itself can be configured through [dbt_project.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml) as usual, which can be found at transform/dbt_project.yml in your Meltano project. dbt also has [adapter-specific documentation for Redshift](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/redshift-configs).

  is an adapter-specific dbt [transformer](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#transformers) allowing you to create new derived transformations from raw data sources.

  ### EDK Preview
  This utility is in a preview stage of readiness. It is based upon our Extension Developer Kit (EDK) which is the new way to build and add plugins to Meltano Hub.
  This preview of dbt will replace the native transformer once it comes out of preview. In the meantime, we would appreciate any feedback in the [EDK repo](https://github.com/meltano/edk/) and in the [dbt Extension repo](https://github.com/meltano/dbt-ext/).

  1. If you're running dbt for the first time in a new environment:

    ```sh
    # create a starter dbt_project.yml file, a profiles.yml file, and models directory
    meltano invoke dbt-redshift:initialize
    ```
