  is an adapter-specific dbt [transformer](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#transformers) for running SQL-based transformations on data stored in your warehouse.

  This utility plugin is meant to be used in favor of the [dbt-redshift transformer plugin type](/transformers/dbt-redshift).
  Note that this plugin can only be run as part of an ELT pipeline with the `meltano run` command. If you are using `meltano elt` you should use the [transformer](/transformers/) plugins. We do recommend migrating to `meltano run` as the transformer plugin type will be deprecated in a future major Meltano release.

  Settings for dbt itself can be configured through [dbt_project.yml](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml) as usual, which can be found at transform/dbt_project.yml in your Meltano project. dbt also has [adapter-specific documentation for Redshift](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/redshift-configs).
