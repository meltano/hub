    where `your-server` is the server IP or domain name. If using metadata service authentication enabled in the image env (recommended),

next_steps: |
  1. Add a source and sink

  #### Add additional database drivers

  You should override the pip url in your meltano config to include each of the plugins
  you want to use with the ingestion framework

  1. Find the `datahub` plugin definition in your `meltano.yml` project file
  2. Update the `pip_url` property to include the desired additional extras:

     ```yaml
     utilities:
     - name: datahub
       variant: acryl
       pip_url: acryl-datahub[rest,mongodb,metabase,bigquery,bigquery-usage,dbt]
     ```
  3. Re-install the plugin:

     ```sh
     meltano install utility datahub
     ```

  The next time you run datahub cli, you will be able to ingest metadata with the appropriate source definition
  as seen [here](https://datahubproject.io/docs/metadata-ingestion).

  This plugin ships with a dbt ingestion recipe via its file-bundle.
