      Start an interactive dbt workbench. Copy and paste model code into the workbench
      or author a model from scratch. The workbench allows you to write dbt with instant
      compile-as-you-type functionality. Spin it up or tear it down as needed.

next_steps: |
  1. Add `dbt-<adapter>` to your pip_url, ie: `pip_url: dbt-osmosis dbt-bigquery`

  2. Override the namespace to mirror your dbt adapter, ie: `namespace: dbt_bigquery`

  3. Mirror the configuration set in your `dbt-<adapter>` plugin. A simple copy-paste of
  the `config:` block should be sufficient.

  4. Ensure you additionally add `adapter: ...` to your dbt-osmosis config for the built
  in commands to work. ie for Bigquery, `adapter: bigquery`

  5. Because of the modified `pip_url`, you should copy the commands from the hub to your local plugin definition for convenience

    This should be set to the adapter you have installed as meltano will install
    dbt and its profile directory into `transform/<adapter>` directory. We use this
    config option to resolve dbt profile directory.
