  This a dbt extension, and therefore requires knowledge and understanding of dbt before adding to your project.
  Please install one of the available dbt extensions from [Meltano Hub](https://hub.meltano.com/utilities/) before proceeding with the rest of the setup.

  1. Specify your dbt adapter in the `pip_url` and in your profiles directory

  Example, in the case of BigQuery:

    ```
    pip_url: elementary-data[bigquery] git+https://github.com/potloc/elementary-ext.git
    config:
      profiles_dir: ${MELTANO_PROJECT_ROOT}/transform/profiles/
    ```

  2. Run dbt deps

  This will populate you `dbt_packages` folder with pertinent dbt models

  It is important to note that you will need to update your dbt packages file when you update your
  your elementary pip url. These 2 different packages **Should have the same version**

  3. Follow elementary setup tutorial

  Tutorial found here: https://docs.elementary-data.com/quickstart

  4. Invoke Elementary

  Run `meltano invoke elementary:monitor-report` and see your brand new report!
