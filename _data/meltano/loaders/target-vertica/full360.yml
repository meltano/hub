- description: Metadata columns add extra row level information about data ingestion's,
    (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted or deleted in vertica
    etc.) Metadata columns are creating automatically by adding extra columns to the
    tables with a column prefix _SDC_. The column names are following the stitch naming
    conventions documented at https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns.
    Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted rows by setting the _SDC_DELETED_AT
    metadata column. Without the add_metadata_columns option the deleted rows from
    singer taps will not be recognizable in Vertica.

- description: When hard_delete option is true then DELETE SQL commands will be performed
    in Vertica to delete rows in tables. It's achieved by continuously checking the
    _SDC_DELETED_AT metadata column sent by the singer tap. Due to deleting rows requires
    metadata columns, hard_delete option automatically enables the add_metadata_columns
    option as well.

    Vertica schemas. If the tap sends the stream_id in <schema_name>-<table_name>
    format then this option overwrites the default_target_schema value. Note, that
    using schema_mapping you can overwrite the default_target_schema_select_permission
    value to grant SELECT permissions to different groups per schemas or optionally
    you can create indices automatically for the replicated tables. Note: This is
    an experimental feature and recommended to use via PipelineWise YAML files that
    will generate the object mapping in the right JSON format. For further info check
    a PipelineWise YAML Example.'
