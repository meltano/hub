  label: Include Timestamp in File Names
  description: |
    Specifies if the files should get timestamped.

    By default, the resulting file will not have a timestamp in the file name (i.e. `exchange_rate.jsonl`).

    If this option gets set to `true`, the resulting file will have a timestamp associated with it (i.e. `exchange_rate-{timestamp}.jsonl`).
