  label: Destination Path
  kind: string
  description: |
    Sets the destination path the JSONL files are written to, relative
    to the project root.

    The directory needs to exist already, it will not be created
    automatically.

    To write JSONL files to the project root, set an empty string (`""`).
  value: output
- name: do_timestamp_file
  kind: boolean
  label: Include Timestamp in File Names
  description: |
    Specifies if the files should get timestamped.

    By default, the resulting file will not have a timestamp in the file name (i.e. `exchange_rate.jsonl`).

    If this option gets set to `true`, the resulting file will have a timestamp associated with it (i.e. `exchange_rate-{timestamp}.jsonl`).
  value: false
- name: custom_name
  label: Custom File Name Override
  kind: string
  description: |
    Specifies a custom name for the filename, instead of the stream name.
    
    The file name will be `{custom_name}-{timestamp}.jsonl`, if `do_timestamp_file` is `true`.
    Otherwise the file name will be `{custom_name}.jsonl`.

    If custom name is not provided, the stream name will be used.
