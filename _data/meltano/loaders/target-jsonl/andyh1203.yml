    Sets the destination path the JSONL files are written to, relative
    to the project root.

    The directory needs to exist already, it will not be created
    automatically.

    To write JSONL files to the project root, set an empty string (`""`).

  label: Include Timestamp in File Names
  description: |
    Specifies if the files should get timestamped.

    By default, the resulting file will not have a timestamp in the file name (i.e. `exchange_rate.jsonl`).

    If this option gets set to `true`, the resulting file will have a timestamp associated with it (i.e. `exchange_rate-{timestamp}.jsonl`).
