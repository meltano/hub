    Useful if you want to load multiple streams from one tap to multiple Postgres schemas.

    If the tap sends the `stream_id` in `<schema_name>-<table_name>` format then this option overwrites the `default_target_schema` value.

    Note, that using `schema_mapping` you can overwrite the `default_target_schema_select_permission` value to grant SELECT permissions to different groups per schemas or optionally you can create indices automatically for the replicated tables.

    This setting can hold an object mapping source schema names to objects with `target_schema` and (optionally) `target_schema_select_permissions` and `indices` keys.

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### `ld`, `clang`, `lssl`, or `linker` Errors
  
  If you have an error message like:
    
    * `ld: library not found for -lssl`
    * `clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1`
    * `error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1`

  These error messages indicates that there is a problem installing OpenSSL. 
  
  This [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26288042/error-installing-psycopg2-library-not-found-for-lssl)
  has specific recommendations on setting the `LDFLAGS` and/or `CPPFLAGS` environment variables.
  Set those prior to running `meltano add loader target-postgres`.
