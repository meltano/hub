    Metadata columns add extra row level information about data ingestions, (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted or deleted in postgres etc.)
     Metadata columns are creating automatically by adding extra columns to the tables with a column prefix `_SDC_`. The column names are following the stitch naming
     conventions documented in the [Stitch Docs](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns). Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted
     rows by setting the _SDC_DELETED_AT metadata column. Without the `add_metadata_columns` option the deleted rows from singer taps will not be recognisable
     in Postgres. Default - False

    Useful if you want to load multiple streams from one tap to multiple
    Postgres schemas.

    If the tap sends the `stream_id` in `<schema_name>-<table_name>`
    format then this option overwrites the `default_target_schema` value. Note,
    that using `schema_mapping` you can overwrite the `default_target_schema_select_permission`
    value to grant SELECT permissions to different groups per schemas or optionally
    you can create indices automatically for the replicated tables.

    This setting can hold an object mapping source schema names to objects with `target_schema` and (optionally) `target_schema_select_permissions` and `indices` keys.

    Example structure (as YAML):


    ```yaml
    schema_mapping:
      my_tap_stream_id:
        target_schema: my_postgres_schema
        target_schema_select_permissions: [ "role_with_select_privs" ]
        indices: ["column_1", "column_2s"]

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### `ld`, `clang`, `lssl`, or `linker` Errors

  If you have an error message like:

    * `ld: library not found for -lssl`
    * `clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1`
    * `error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1`

  These error messages indicates that there is a problem installing OpenSSL.

  This [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26288042/error-installing-psycopg2-library-not-found-for-lssl)
  has specific recommendations on setting the `LDFLAGS` and/or `CPPFLAGS` environment variables.
  Set those prior to running `meltano add loader target-postgres`.
