  description: 'The maximum number of bytes to buffer in memory before writing to
    the destination table in Postgres. Default: 100MB in bytes'
- name: batch_detection_threshold
  kind: integer
  description: How often, in rows received, to count the buffered rows and bytes to
    check if a flush is necessary. There's a slight performance penalty to checking
    the buffered records count or bytesize, so this controls how often this is polled
    in order to mitigate the penalty. This value is usually not necessary to set as
    the default is dynamically adjusted to check reasonably often.
- name: state_support
  kind: boolean
  value: true
  description: Whether the Target should emit `STATE` messages to stdout for further
    consumption. In this mode, which is on by default, STATE messages are buffered
    in memory until all the records that occurred before them are flushed according
    to the batch flushing schedule the target is configured with.
- name: add_upsert_indexes
  kind: boolean
  value: true
  description: Whether the Target should create column indexes on the important columns
    used during data loading. These indexes will make data loading slightly slower
    but the deduplication phase much faster. Defaults to on for better baseline performance.

  description: Raw SQL statement(s) to execute as soon as the connection to Postgres
    is opened by the target. Useful for setup like `SET ROLE` or other connection
