    Note that `$MELTANO_EXTRACT__LOAD_SCHEMA` [will expand to](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/configuration.html#expansion-in-setting-values) the value of the [`load_schema` extra](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#load-schema-extra) for the extractor used in the pipeline, which defaults to the extractor's namespace, e.g. `tap_gitlab` for [`tap-gitlab`](/extractors/gitlab).

    Name of the schema where the tables will be created. If `schema_mapping`
    is not defined then every stream sent by the tap is loaded into this schema.

    The maximum number of bytes to buffer in memory before writing to the destination table in Postgres. Default: 100MB in bytes
- name: batch_detection_threshold
  label: Batch Detection Threshold
  kind: integer
  description: |
    How often, in rows received, to count the buffered rows and bytes to
    check if a flush is necessary.

    There's a slight performance penalty to checking
    the buffered records count or bytesize, so this controls how often this is polled
    in order to mitigate the penalty. This value is usually not necessary to set as
    the default is dynamically adjusted to check reasonably often.
- name: state_support
  label: State Support
  kind: boolean
  value: true
  description: |
    Whether the Target should emit `STATE` messages to stdout for further
    consumption.

    In this mode, which is on by default, STATE messages are buffered
    in memory until all the records that occurred before them are flushed according
    to the batch flushing schedule the target is configured with.
- name: add_upsert_indexes
  label: Add Upsert Indexes
  kind: boolean
  value: true
  description: |
    Whether the Target should create column indexes on the important columns
    used during data loading.

    These indexes will make data loading slightly slower
    but the deduplication phase much faster. Defaults to on for better baseline performance.

  #### Dependencies

  `target-postgres` [requires](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#runtime-requirements) the
  [`libpq` library](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) to be available on your system.
  If you've installed PostgreSQL, you should already have it, but you can also install it by itself using the
  [`libpq-dev` package](https://pkgs.org/download/libpq-dev) on Ubuntu/Debian or the
  [`libpq` Homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libpq) on macOS.

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Error: `psycopg2.ProgrammingError: syntax error at or near "-"`

  This error message indicates that the extractor you are using this loader with generates
  stream names that include the source database schema in addition to the table name: `<schema>-<table>`, e.g. `public-accounts`.
  This is not supported by [this variant](#alternative-variants) of `target-postgres`.

  Instead, use the [`transferwise` variant](https://meltano.com/plugins/loaders/postgres--transferwise.html) which was made to be used with extractors that behave this way.

  ### Error: `pg_config executable not found` or `libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory`

  This error message indicates that the [`libpq`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) dependency is missing.

  To resolve this, refer to the ["Dependencies" section](#dependencies) above.

  ### `ld`, `clang`, `lssl`, or `linker` Errors

  If you have an error message like:

    * `ld: library not found for -lssl`
    * `clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1`
    * `error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1`

  These error messages indicates that there is a problem installing OpenSSL.

  This [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26288042/error-installing-psycopg2-library-not-found-for-lssl)
  has specific recommendations on setting the `LDFLAGS` and/or `CPPFLAGS` environment variables.
  Set those prior to running `meltano add loader target-postgres`.
