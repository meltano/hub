    Note `$MELTANO_EXTRACT__LOAD_SCHEMA` [will expand to](https://docs.meltano.com/configuration.html#expansion-in-setting-values) the value of the [`load_schema` extra](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#load-schema-extra) for the extractor used in the pipeline, which defaults to the extractor's namespace, e.g. `tap_gitlab` for [`tap-gitlab`](/extractors/gitlab). Values are automatically converted to uppercase before they're passed on to the plugin, so `tap_gitlab` becomes `TAP_GITLAB`.
