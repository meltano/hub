  #### Dependencies

  A Snowflake `FILE FORMAT` object must exist prior to execution and is a required config input. You can use the sample SQL provided below:

  ```sql
  CREATE FILE FORMAT {database}.{schema}.{file_format_name}
  TYPE = 'CSV' ESCAPE='\\' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='"';
  ```

  See the [documentation](https://github.com/transferwise/pipelinewise-target-snowflake#pre-requirements) for more details on other optional objects and how to create them.

- description: Metadata columns add extra row level information about data ingestions,
    (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted or deleted in snowflake

    tables with a column prefix `_SDC_`. The column names are following the stitch
    naming conventions documented at https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns.
    Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted rows by setting the `_SDC_DELETED_AT`
    metadata column. Without the `add_metadata_columns` option the deleted rows from
    singer taps will not be recongisable in Snowflake.

    Note `$MELTANO_EXTRACT__LOAD_SCHEMA` [will expand to](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/configuration.html#expansion-in-setting-values) the value of the [`load_schema` extra](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#load-schema-extra) for the extractor used in the pipeline, which defaults to the extractor's namespace, e.g. `tap_gitlab` for [`tap-gitlab`](/extractors/gitlab). Values are automatically converted to uppercase before they're passed on to the plugin, so `tap_gitlab` becomes `TAP_GITLAB`.

    Useful if you want to load multiple streams from one tap to multiple Snowflake schemas.

    If the tap sends the `stream_id` in `<schema_name>-<table_name>` format then this option overwrites the `default_target_schema` value.

    Note, that using `schema_mapping` you can overwrite the `default_target_schema_select_permission` value to grant SELECT permissions to different groups per schemas or optionally you can create indices automatically for the replicated tables.

  ## How Schema Changes Are Handled

  See the [pipelinewise](https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise/user_guide/schema_changes.html#schema-changes) for the full documentation.
  Here are some of the important details:

  ### 1. New Column Added

  Target connectors add the new column to the destination table with the same name using a compatible data type.

  ### 2. Column Dropped

  Target connectors DO NOT drop columns. Old column remains in the table in case you need to do historical analysis on the column.

  ### 3. Column Data Type Changed

  Target connectors version the columns. See the [versioning columns docs](https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise/user_guide/schema_changes.html#versioning-columns) for syntax.
