    Note `$MELTANO_EXTRACT__LOAD_SCHEMA` [will expand to](https://docs.meltano.com/configuration.html#expansion-in-setting-values) the value of the [`load_schema` extra](https://docs.meltano.com/concepts/plugins#load-schema-extra) for the extractor used in the pipeline, which defaults to the extractor's namespace, e.g. `tap_gitlab` for [`tap-gitlab`](/extractors/gitlab). Values are automatically converted to uppercase before they're passed on to the plugin, so `tap_gitlab` becomes `TAP_GITLAB`.

  #### Dependencies

  `target-snowflake` [requires](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#runtime-requirements) the
  [`libpq` library](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) to be available on your system.
  If you've installed PostgreSQL, you should already have it, but you can also install it by itself using the
  [`libpq-dev` package](https://pkgs.org/download/libpq-dev) on Ubuntu/Debian or the
  [`libpq` Homebrew formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libpq) on macOS.

  ## Troubleshooting

  ### Error: `pg_config executable not found` or `libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory`

  This error message indicates that the [`libpq`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html) dependency is missing.

  To resolve this, refer to the ["Dependencies" section](#dependencies) above.
