- description: Metadata columns add extra row level information about data ingestions,
    (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted or deleted in postgres
    etc.) Metadata columns are creating automatically by adding extra columns to the
    tables with a column prefix _SDC_. The column names are following the stitch naming
    conventions documented at https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns.
    Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted rows by setting the _SDC_DELETED_AT
    metadata column. Without the add_metadata_columns option the deleted rows from
    singer taps will not be recognisable in DuckDB.

- description: When hard_delete option is true then DELETE SQL commands will be performed
    in DuckDB to delete rows in tables. It's achieved by continuously checking the
    _SDC_DELETED_AT metadata column sent by the singer tap. Due to deleting rows requires
    metadata columns, hard_delete option automatically enables the add_metadata_columns
    option as well.
