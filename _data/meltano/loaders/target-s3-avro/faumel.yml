- description: The API version to use. By default, botocore will use the latest API
    version when creating a client. You only need to specify this parameter if you
    want to use a previous API version of the client.
  label: Api Version
  name: api_version
- description: The access key to use when creating the client. This is entirely optional,
    and if not provided, the credentials configured for the session will automatically
    be used. You only need to provide this argument if you want to override the credentials
    used for this specific client.
  kind: password
  label: Aws Access Key Id
  name: aws_access_key_id
  sensitive: true
- description: The secret key to use when creating the client. Same semantics as aws_access_key_id
    above.
  kind: password
  label: Aws Secret Access Key
  name: aws_secret_access_key

- description: The session token to use when creating the client. Same semantics as
    aws_access_key_id.
  kind: password

- description: Advanced client configuration options. If region_name is specified
    in the client config, its value will take precedence over environment variables
    and configuration values, but not over a region_name value passed explicitly to
    the method. See botocore config documentation for more details. See [boto 
    Docs](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html)
    for more details.
  label: Config
  name: config
- description: The complete URL to use for the constructed client. Normally, botocore
    will automatically construct the appropriate URL to use when communicating with
    a service. You can specify a complete URL (including the "http/https" scheme)
    to override this behavior. If this value is provided, then use_ssl is ignored.
  label: Endpoint Url
  name: endpoint_url
- description: The delimiter to use when flatttening records.
