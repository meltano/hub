- name: verify
  label: Verify

    aws_access_key_id.

- name: api_version
  label: Api Version

    version when creating a client. You only need to specify this parameter if you
    want to use a previous API version of the client.
- name: endpoint_url
  label: Endpoint Url
  description: The complete URL to use for the constructed client. Normally, botocore
    will automatically construct the appropriate URL to use when communicating with
    a service. You can specify a complete URL (including the "http/https" scheme)
    to override this behavior. If this value is provided, then use_ssl is ignored.
- name: aws_secret_access_key
  label: Aws Secret Access Key
  description: The secret key to use when creating the client. Same semantics as aws_access_key_id
    above.
  kind: password

  label: Aws Access Key Id
  description: The access key to use when creating the client. This is entirely optional,
    and if not provided, the credentials configured for the session will automatically
    be used. You only need to provide this argument if you want to override the credentials
    used for this specific client.

  description: Schema destination bucket and key folder in the format of {bucket}/{key}
- name: config
  label: Config
  description: Advanced client configuration options. If region_name is specified
    in the client config, its value will take precedence over environment variables
    and configuration values, but not over a region_name value passed explicitly to
    the method. See botocore config documentation for more details. See [boto Docs](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html)
    for more details.
