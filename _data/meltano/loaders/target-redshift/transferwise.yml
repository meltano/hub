    Metadata columns add extra row level information about data ingestions,
    (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted or deleted in redshift
    etc.) Metadata columns are creating automatically by adding extra columns to the
    tables with a column prefix `_SDC_`.

    The metadata columns are documented at https://transferwise.github.io/pipelinewise/data_structure/sdc-columns.html.
    Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted rows by setting the _SDC_DELETED_AT
    metadata column.

    Without the `add_metadata_columns` option the deleted rows from
    singer taps will not be recongisable in Redshift.

    Useful if you want to load multiple streams from one tap to multiple
    Redshift schemas.

    If the tap sends the `stream_id` in `<schema_name>-<table_name>`
    format then this option overwrites the `default_target_schema` value.

    Note, that using `schema_mapping` you can overwrite the `default_target_schema_select_permissions`
    value to grant SELECT permissions to different groups per schemas or optionally
    you can create indices automatically for the replicated tables.
