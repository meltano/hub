  description: '(Default: False) Validate every single record message to the corresponding

    earlier but could cause performance degradation.'

  description: "(Default: False) When hard_delete option is true then DELETE SQL commands\
    \ will be performed in iomete to delete rows in tables. It's achieved by continuously\
    \ checking the _SDC_DELETED_AT metadata column sent by the singer tap. Due to\
    \ deleting rows requires metadata columns, hard_delete option automatically enables\
    \ the add_metadata_columns option as well."

  description: '(Default: False) Metadata columns add extra row level information
    about data ingestions, (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted
    or deleted in iomete etc.) Metadata columns are creating automatically by adding
    extra columns to the tables with a column prefix _SDC_. The column names are following
    the stitch naming conventions documented at https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns.
    Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted rows by setting the _SDC_DELETED_AT
    metadata column. Without the add_metadata_columns option the deleted rows from
    singer taps will not be recongisable in iomete.'
