This directory is a standard Jekyll directory that contains data that can be accessed by the site.
Currently `taps`, and `targets` directories are all static so whats checked into git is current.
The `audit.yml`, `metrics.yml`, and `meltano` directory are only samples for local testing.
During the CI build process the updated version of `audit.yml` and `metrics.yml` are retrieved from an external source and the `meltano` directory is generated by splitting out the `discovery.yml` file from the Meltano project.
These generated files are then used in building the site.
