    settings:
      - name: name
        label: Name
        description: (required) name of the stream.
      - name: api_url
        label: API Base URL
        description: (required) the base url/endpoint for the desired api.
      - name: path
        label: Path
        description: (optional) the path appeneded to the `api_url`.
      - name: params
        label: Params
        description: (optional) an object of objects that provide the `params` in a `requests.get` method.
      - name: headers
        label: Headers
        description: (optional) an object of headers to pass into the api calls.
      - name: records_path
        label: Records Path
        description: (optional) a jsonpath string representing the path in the requests response that contains the records to process. Defaults to `$[*]`.
      - name: primary_keys
        label: Primary Keys
        description: (required) a list of the json keys of the primary key for the stream.
      - name: replication_key
        label: Replication Key
        description: (optional) the json key of the replication key. Note that this should be an incrementing integer or datetime object.
      - name: except_keys
        label: Except Keys
        description: This tap automatically flattens the entire json structure and builds keys based on the corresponding paths. Keys, whether composite or otherwise, listed in this dictionary will not be recursively flattened, but instead their values will be turned into a json string and processed in that format. This is also automatically done for any lists within the records; therefore, records are not duplicated for each item in lists.
      - name: num_inference_records
        label: Number Inference Records
        description: (optional) number of records used to infer the stream's schema. Defaults to 50.
