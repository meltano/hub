    label: Name

      method.

  - name: records_path
    label: Records Path
    description: (optional) a jsonpath string representing the path in the requests
      response that contains the records to process. Defaults to `$[*]`.
  - name: primary_keys

  - name: replication_key
    label: Replication Key

  - name: except_keys
    label: Except Keys
    description: This tap automatically flattens the entire json structure and builds
      keys based on the corresponding paths. Keys, whether composite or otherwise,
      listed in this dictionary will not be recursively flattened, but instead their
      values will be turned into a json string and processed in that format. This
      is also automatically done for any lists within the records; therefore, records
      are not duplicated for each item in lists.
  - name: num_inference_records
    label: Number Inference Records
    description: (optional) number of records used to infer the stream's schema. Defaults
      to 50.
