  # TODO: `metadata` is not appropriate for hub, but necessary in Meltano because the default selection
  # of `*.*` which selects all streams and properties is invalid. (See not on fieldExclusions in readme)
  # It'd be better to mark these with `selected-by-default: false` in `tap-bing-ads`'s catalog
  # Meltano doesn't support that yet, though: https://gitlab.com/meltano/meltano/-/issues/2556
