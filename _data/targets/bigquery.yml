  - name: schema_mapping
    description: (Experimental) Useful if you want to load multiple streams from one tap to multiple BigQuery schemas. If the tap sends the stream_id in <schema_name>-<table_name> format then this option overwrites the default_target_schema value. Note, that using schema_mapping you can overwrite the default_target_schema_select_permission value to grant SELECT permissions to different groups per schemas or optionally you can create indices automatically for the replicated tables.

    kind: object
  - name: add_metadata_columns
    description: Metadata columns add extra row level information about data ingestions, (i.e. when was the row read in source, when was inserted or deleted in bigquery etc.) Metadata columns are creating automatically by adding extra columns to the tables with a column prefix _sdc_. The column names are following the stitch naming conventions documented at https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/data-structure/integration-schemas#sdc-columns. Enabling metadata columns will flag the deleted rows by setting the _sdc_deleted_at metadata column. Without the add_metadata_columns option the deleted rows from singer taps will not be recognisable in BigQuery.
    kind: boolean
    value: false
    label: Add Metadata Columns
  - name: hard_delete
    description: When hard_delete option is true then DELETE SQL commands will be performed in BigQuery to delete rows in tables. It's achieved by continuously checking the _sdc_deleted_at metadata column sent by the singer tap. Due to deleting rows requires metadata columns, hard_delete option automatically enables the add_metadata_columns option as well.

  - name: data_flattening_max_level

    value: true
  - name: validate_records
    description: Validate every single record message to the corresponding JSON schema. This option is disabled by default and invalid RECORD messages will fail only at load time by BigQuery. Enabling this option will detect invalid records earlier but could cause performance degradation.

    value: false
